#### Thoughts from Class

* Produce Insightful Analysis
    * Relate it to problem and research question 

* Integrating Data Together - Play with caution
    * Break it down if thats the case to make it 

* Should we focus on the single Problem or multiple Problem?
    * Its Purely based on the Research Question we are focusing on

* Post the Machine Learning Model Phase, collaborate and analyse the Results
    * Produce and develop why each persons analysis is not like others
    * Like how it is different from other analysis in the team
    * Narrate in each one own word on the Result Analysis




#### Formulating Research Question

* Go through the Dataset and analyse based on the findings formulate the Research Question
    * What we are going to do (Eg : Our Research is focusing on creating Credit Score for People based on So and So Reason)
    * What Attributes we are going to consider/ based on what attributes we are going to build our analysis.


* Which Machine Learning Models are supposed to be used
    * Machine Learning Techniques explained in the Alexandaro Module Technique


#### Regarding the Machine Learning Models - _Alexandro_ Comments

**Supervised Learning Method**

* NN - Neural Networks
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* SVM - Support Vector Machines
* KNN - K Nearest Neighbours
