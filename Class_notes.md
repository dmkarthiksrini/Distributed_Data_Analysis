#### Thoughts from Class

* Produce Insightful Analysis
    * Relate it to problem and research question 

* Integrating Data Together - Play with caution
    * Break it down if thats the case to make it 

* Should we focus on the single Problem or multiple Problem?
    * Its Purely based on the Research Question we are focusing on

* Post the Machine Learning Model Phase, collaborate and anlyse the Results
    * Produce and develop why each persons analysis is not like others
    * Like how it is different from other analysis in the team
    * Narrate in each one own word on the Result Ananlysis
